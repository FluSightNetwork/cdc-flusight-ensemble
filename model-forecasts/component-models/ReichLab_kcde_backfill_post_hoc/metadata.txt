  Used leave-one-season-out cross-validation in the training phase to estimate
  1) parameters of kernel conditional density estimation (KCDE) models for
  incidence h steps ahead, for h = 1, ..., 35; and 2) parameters of a copula C^H
  modeling dependence structure across the next H weeks, for H = 2, ..., 35.
  Together, these yield a joint predictive distribution for incidence in all
  remaining weeks of the season.  Appropriate integrals of this joint
  distribution are calculated via Monte Carlo integration to obtain predictions
  for the seasonal quantities.  For making prospective predictions for each
  season, only data before the start of that season were used in fitting model
  parameters.  After predictions are made based on currently available ilinet
  data, a post-hoc adjustment for backfill is made by sampling possible
  revisions to data.  These adjustments affect forecasts for seasonal targets
  only.  All code used in estimation and prediction is available at
