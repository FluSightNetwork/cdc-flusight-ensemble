  The method implements an autoregressive model on the weighted ILI time series,
  and derives a sparse model using a likelihood ratio based model selection. The
  method is an example of a stepwise regression method with an augmentation
  phase followed by and a reduction phase, where variables (in this case, lags)
  are added or removed based on the log-ratio of error term variances with and
  without the variable. Only producing short-term forecasts through this method,
  and seasonal forecasts are set to Uniform distribution. Out-of-sample
  forecasts were generated by using data from Delphi's Epidata API. Missing
  weeks in early seasons (e.g., EW20-40 for HHS regions before 2014) which were
  retrospectively filled in 2013EW52, were treated as missing, and filled by
  linear interpolation.
