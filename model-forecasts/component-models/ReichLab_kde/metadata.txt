  This model uses kernel density estimation to estimate a distribution for each
  seasonal target and a generalized additive model (GAM) with a cyclical
  seasonal spline to estimate the x-week ahead incidence targets. Both models
  are based on observed values of that target in previous seasons within the
  region of interest. We used Gaussian kernels and the default KDE settings from
  the density function in the stats package for R to estimate the bandwidth
  parameter for each KDE fit. For the peak incidence target, we fit to
  log-transformed observations of historical peak incidence. For the onset week
  prediction target, we estimated the probability of no onset as the proportion
  of region-seasons in all regions in the training phase where no week in the
  season met the criteria for being a season onset. We use the mccv R package to
  fit the GAMs. All code used in estimation and prediction is available at
