  Uses the Empirical Bayes method as described here:
  http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004382,
  but using smaller local transformations to form the prior, starting
  trajectories with week 31, and conditioning only on the past 4 weeks' wILI
  values.  A small amount of smoothing is applied when calculating target
  distributions.  All parameter settings are heuristically chosen.  All training
  seasons precede the test season, and observations from the test season use
  mimicPastEpidataDF to approximate what the ILINet report for the forecast week
  looked like.  The code for generating these forecasts is available at
  https://github.com/cmu-delphi/epiforecast-R.
