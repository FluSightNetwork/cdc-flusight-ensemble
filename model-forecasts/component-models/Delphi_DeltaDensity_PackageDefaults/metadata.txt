model_name: Delta Density (epiforecast package defaults)
model_abbr: DeltaDensity1
anonymity: named
data_source1: ILINet
data_source2: 
this_model_is_an_ensemble: FALSE
methods: Uses kernel conditional density estimation (using training seasons) to model the week-on-week change in wILI, conditioned on features of recent observations.  Features are heuristically selected; parameters values are manually chosen using data from seasons before the test period.  A small amount of smoothing is applied when calculating target distributions.  All training seasons precede the test season, and observations from the test season use mimicPastEpidataDF to approximate what the ILINet report for the forecast week looked like.  The code for generating these forecasts is available at https://github.com/cmu-delphi/epiforecast-R.
