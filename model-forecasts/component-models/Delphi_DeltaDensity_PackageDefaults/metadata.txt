  Uses kernel conditional density estimation (using training seasons) to model
  the week-on-week change in wILI, conditioned on features of recent
  observations.  Features are heuristically selected; parameters values are
  manually chosen using data from seasons before the test period.  A small
  amount of smoothing is applied when calculating target distributions.  All
  training seasons precede the test season, and observations from the test
  season use mimicPastEpidataDF to approximate what the ILINet report for the
  forecast week looked like.  The code for generating these forecasts is
  available at https://github.com/cmu-delphi/epiforecast-R.
