  This model is a weighted ensemble between three component models. The first 
  component is a seasonal average model constructed using Gaussian kernel
  densities based on previously observed data from the 2001/2001 season onwards,
  excluding the 2009/2010 pandemic season. The second component is the Protea
  Kudu model, described in more detail there. The final component is the Protea
  Springbok model, described in more detail there. Models are combined using
  monthly target-type weights, and the weighting scheme was chosen using
  leave-one-season-out cross validation in a similar  method to the FluSight
  Network ensemble.  For prospective forecasts, only ILINet data known at the
  time of the forecast are  used, as retrieved from the CMU-Epidata API. For
  subtype percentages, the  backfilled data are not available, however we use
  the cumulative percentage of  samples of each subtype at a given week of the
  season rather than the weekly percentage,  which is less susceptible to
  backfill effects as the season goes on. All code used in  estimation and
  prediction is available at https://github.com/craigjmcgowan/FluForecast
