  This model is a weighted ensemble between three component models. The first 
  component is a seasonal average model constructed using Gaussian kernel densities
  based on previously observed data from the 2001/2001 season onwards, excluding
  the 2009/2010 pandemic season. The second component is an influenza subtype-
  specific historical average model. Separate Gaussian kernel densities for H1 
  and H3 seasons from prior ILINet data weighted by the cumulative proportion of
  viruses from each subtype at a given point in the season. Forecasts are generated
  by weighting each subtype-specific density by the cumulative observed ratio of H1 
  and H3 viruses at each week and integrating the predictive density. The final 
  component is the Protea Springbok model, described in more detail there. Models are
  combined using monthly target-type weights, and the weighting scheme was chosen using leave-one-
  season-out cross validation in a similar method to the FluSight Network ensemble. 
  For prospective forecasts, only ILINet data known at the time of the forecast are 
  used, as retrieved from the CMU-Epidata API. For subtype percentages, the 
  backfilled data are not available, however we use the cumulative percentage of 
  samples of each subtype at a given week of the season rather than the weekly percentage, 
  which is less susceptible to backfill effects as the season goes on. All code used in 
  estimation and prediction is available at https://github.com/craigjmcgowan/FluForecast
