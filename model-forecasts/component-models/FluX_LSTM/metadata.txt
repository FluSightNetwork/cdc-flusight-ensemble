  An LSTM based deep learning predictor which learns patterns from historical time series. 
  It models non-linear relationships between weekly data points and makes forecasts by 
  looking back to the time sequence of data points of previous weeks. The model provides 
  probabilistic forecasting by using MC-Dropout technology and considers uncertainty from models, 
  predictions, and backfill data. Out-of-sample forecasts were generated by using data from Delphi's 
  Epidata API. Missing weeks in early seasons (e.g., EW20-40 for HHS regions before 2014) which were 
  retrospectively filled in 2013EW52, were treated as missing, and filled by forward fill.
