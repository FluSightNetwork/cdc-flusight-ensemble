model_name: Basis Regression (epiforecast package defaults)
model_abbr: BasisRegression
anonymity: named
data_source1: ILINet
data_source2: 
this_model_is_an_ensemble: FALSE
methods: Constructs a set of "pseudo-trajectories" by splicing together (a) the observed part of the test season with (b) each training season's trajectory for later portions of the season.  Estimates a mean curve for the pseudo-trajectories by regressing onto a set of basis elements.  Forecasts the singleton distribution containing this curve, plus a large, heuristic amount of smoothing for each of the targets.  All training seasons precede the test season, and observations from the test season use mimicPastEpidataDF to approximate what the ILINet report for the forecast week looked like.  The code for generating these forecasts is available at https://github.com/cmu-delphi/epiforecast-R.
