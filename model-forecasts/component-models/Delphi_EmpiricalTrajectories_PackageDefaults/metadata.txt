methods: Models the test season's trajectory as a duplicate of a randomly, equiprobably selected training season --- ignores all observations from the test season.  A medium amount of smoothing is applied when calculating target distributions.  All training seasons precede the test season, and observations from the test season use mimicPastEpidataDF to approximate what the ILINet report for the forecast week looked like.  The code for generating these forecasts is available at https://github.com/cmu-delphi/epiforecast-R.
