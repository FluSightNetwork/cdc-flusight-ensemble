  The forecasting method uses basic empirical dynamic modeling to make
  predictions. This method uses a topological transformation of time series data
  to identify previous states of the time series that are similar to the current
  state. To make predictions it chooses a neighborhood of nearest neighbors of
  the current state, and projects those forward. Predictions are then made by
  the resultant location of the neighborhood (Sugihara And May 1990). In essence
  it's similar to a topological method of analogues approach. The model output
  is a mean and variance for future states of the time series. We simulate from
  a normal distribution with those parameters to generate potential time courses
  for the epidemic, and use those potential trajectories to obtain our target
  probability distributions. The model is implemented using R, and harnesses the
  rEDM package for running the forecasts and the epiforecast R package to ensure
  proper historical data use.
