  This model is an influenza subtype-specific historical average model.
  Separate  Gaussian kernel densities for H1 and H3 behavior are calculated from
  prior ILINet data weighted  by the cumulative proportion of viruses from each
  subtype at a given point in the  season. Forecasts are generated by weighting
  each subtype-specific density by the  cumulative observed ratio of H1 and H3
  viruses at each week and integrating the  predictive density. For prospective
  forecasts, only ILINet data known at the time  of the forecast are used, as
  retrieved from the CMU-Epidata API. For subtype percentages, the  backfilled
  data are not available, however we use the cumulative percentage of  samples
  of each subtype at a given week of the season rather than the weekly
  percentage,  which is less susceptible to backfill effects as the season goes
  on. All code used in  estimation and prediction is available at
