methods: DBMplus (DBM+) is partitioned into two parts: the DBM part and the “+” part. 

The dynamic Bayesian model (DBM) part is the probabilistic model. It combines an SIR model with a flexible, hierarchical discrepancy model in a Bayesian framework. Methodological details can be found here: https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdfview_1/euclid.ba/1533866670.

The ”+” part refers to Google-based nowcasts. DBM+ uses internet-based nowcasts (1-week-ahead) appended to available ILI data and treats the nowcast exactly as if it were CDC-released ILI data. To our knowledge, Google data do not have backfill issues. Google data were pulled after the forecast dates, but we do not believe that is an issue. Google data are based on a random sample, thus it is not possible to exactly reproduce the pulls.

To produce forecasts, DBM+ requires historical data, ideally from EW 40 of 1997 through the forecast date, sans the H1N1 2008/2009 and 2009/2010 seasons. To our knowledge, the earliest date on which all historical data are available is EW 52 of 2013 through the DELPHI API. For flu seasons 2014/15 through 2017/18, all ILI data used in the forecasts strictly respect the backfill issue (i.e., all ILI data used in the fitting of DBM+ were pulled on or before the forecast date). For seasons 2010/11 through 2013/14, historical ILI data from 1997, EW 40 through 2008, EW 25 were pulled on 2013, EW 52 (i.e., NOT strictly obeying the backfill issue).
