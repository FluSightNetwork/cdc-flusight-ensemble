  EpiCos is an ODE model developed to match the historical trends in wILI.  To
  combine the wILI with the model during the season, a variational data
  assimilation  method is used (sometimes called 4D-Var) to fit model parameters
  and initial  condition of the differential equation. For the data assimilation
  piece of EpiCos, a  prior distribution of the parameters is estimated by
  fitting the model to historical  data available by the time of the first
  forecast of the season, i.e. EW 40. Through  the Delphi API the furthest back
  we were able to obtain the historical wILI data from  EW 40 of 1997 through EW
  20 of 2008 was issued on EW 52 of 2013 (this does not  strictly abide by the
  backfill availability, but is likely that these values do not  differ much
  from data that would have been available in 2010). Aside from these weeks, 
  wILI historical data was only used that was issued by the forecast date. For
  example,  to forecast the 2010-2011 season, priors were estimated using wILI
  from EW 40 in 1997  through EW 40 in 2010, where the wILI for EW 40 of 2008
  through EW 40 of 2010 were  only issued as recently as EW 40 in 2010. A
  forecast for EW 50 in the 2010 season  would then only use wILI data from the
  current season that had been issued by EW 50  in 2010.  From the 2014-15 flu
  season onward, the backfill issue was fully adhered  to even during the
  estimation of the prior distribution step.
