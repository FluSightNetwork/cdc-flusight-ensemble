anonymity: named
data_source1: other models
data_source2: 
this_model_is_an_ensemble: TRUE
methods: This is an ensemble of stacked entries from all component models. We use degenerate EM algorithm to estimate weights for each model that are specific for each target-type (i.e. one set of weights for the weekly incidence outcomes and another for the seasonal outcomes).
