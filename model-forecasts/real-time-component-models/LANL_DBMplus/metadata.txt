  DBMplus (DBM+) is partitioned into two parts: the DBM part and the '+' part. 
  The dynamic Bayesian model (DBM) part is the probabilistic model It combines 
  an SIR model with a flexible discrepancy model in a Bayesian framework. 
  Methodological details can be found here: 
  https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdfview_1/euclid.ba/1533866670. The '+'
  part refers to Google-based nowcasts. DBM+ uses internet-based  nowcasts
  (1-week-ahead) appended to available ILI data and treats the nowcast  exactly
  as if it were CDC-released ILI data. To our knowledge, Google data  does not
  have backfill issues. Google data were pulled after the forecast  dates, but
  we do not believe that is an issue. Google data is based on a  random sample,
  thus reproducing the pulls exactly is not possible. To produce forecasts, DBM+
  requires historical data, ideally from EW 40 of  1997 through the forecast
  date, sans the H1N1 2008/2009 and 2009/2010 seasons.  To our knowledge, the
  earliest date on which all historical data are available  is EW 52 of 2013
  through the DELPHI API. For flu seasons 2014/2015, 2015/2016,  and 2016/2017,
  all ILI data used in the forecasts strictly respect the  backfill issue (i.e.,
  all ILI data used in the fitting of the DBM was pulled  on or before the
  forecast date). For seasons 2010/2011 through 2013/2014,  historical ILI data
  from 1997, EW 40 through 2008, EW 25 was pulled on 2013,  EW 52 (i.e., NOT
  strictly obeying the backfill issue).
