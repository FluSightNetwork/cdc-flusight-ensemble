  The DBM combines an SIR model with a flexible discrepancy function in a
  Bayesian framework. Methodological details can be found here:
  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.09481.pdf. To produce forecasts, the DBM requires
  historical data, ideally from EW 40 of 1997 through the forecast date, sans
  the H1N1 2008/2009 and 2009/2010 seasons. To our knowledge, the earliest date
  on which all historical data is available is EW 52 of 2013 through the DELPHI
  API. For flu seasons 2014/2015, 2015/2016, and 2016/2017, all forecasts
  strictly respect the backfill issue (i.e., all data used in the fitting of the
  DBM was pulled on or before the forecast date). For seasons 2010/2011 through
  2013/2014, historical data from 1997, EW 40 through 2008, EW 25 was pulled on
  2013, EW 52 (i.e., NOT strictly obeying the backfill issue) while all other
  used data was pulled on or before the forecast date.
