  Uses the Empirical Bayes method as described here:
  http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004382,
  but using smaller local transformations to form the prior, and starting
  trajectories with week 31.  A small amount of smoothing is applied when
  calculating target distributions.  All parameter settings are heuristically
  chosen.  All training seasons precede the test season, and observations from
  the test season use mimicPastEpidataDF to approximate what the ILINet report
  for the forecast week looked like.  The code for generating these forecasts is
  available at https://github.com/cmu-delphi/epiforecast-R.
