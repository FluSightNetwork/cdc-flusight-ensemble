  Constructs a set of "pseudo-trajectories" by splicing together (a) the
  observed part of the test season with (b) each training season's trajectory
  for later portions of the season.  Estimates a mean curve for the
  pseudo-trajectories by regressing onto a set of basis elements.  Forecasts the
  singleton distribution containing this curve, plus a large, heuristic amount
  of smoothing for each of the targets.  All training seasons precede the test
  season, and observations from the test season use mimicPastEpidataDF to
  approximate what the ILINet report for the forecast week looked like.  The
  code for generating these forecasts is available at
  https://github.com/cmu-delphi/epiforecast-R.
