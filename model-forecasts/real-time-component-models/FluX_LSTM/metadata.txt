  An LSTM based deep learning predictor which learns patterns from historical
  time series.  It models non-linear relationships between weekly data points
  and makes forecasts by  looking back to the time sequence of data points of
  previous weeks. The model provides  probabilistic forecasting by using
  MC-Dropout technology and considers uncertainty from models,  predictions, and
  backfill data. Out-of-sample forecasts were generated by using data from
  Delphi's  Epidata API. Missing weeks in early seasons (e.g., EW20-40 for HHS
  regions before 2014) which were  retrospectively filled in 2013EW52, were
  treated as missing, and filled by forward fill.
