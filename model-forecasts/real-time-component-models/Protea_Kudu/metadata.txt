  This model is an influenza subtype-specific historical average model.
  Separate Gaussian kernel densities for H1 and H3 behavior are calculated from
  prior ILINet data weighted by the cumulative proportion of viruses from each 
  subtype at a given point in the season (for seasonal targets) or the proportion
  of viruses in the prior 6 weeks (for week ahead targets). Forecasts are generated 
  by weighting each subtype-specific density by the observed ratios of H1 and H3
  viruses at each week and integrating the predictive density. For prospective
  forecasts, only ILINet data known at the time of the forecast are used, as
  retrieved from the CMU-Epidata API. For subtype percentages, the backfilled
  data are not available. The cumulative percentage of samples
  of each subtype at a given week of the season are less susceptible to backfill
  effects as the season goes on than weekly values. All code used in estimation 
  and prediction is available at  https://github.com/craigjmcgowan/FluForecast
