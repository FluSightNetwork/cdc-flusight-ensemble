  Models the remainder of the test season's trajectory as a duplicate of a
  randomly, equiprobably selected training season, concatenated onto the
  available observations from the test season.  A medium amount of smoothing is
  applied when calculating target distributions.  All training seasons precede
  the test season, and observations from the test season use mimicPastEpidataDF
  to approximate what the ILINet report for the forecast week looked like.  The
  code for generating these forecasts is available at
  https://github.com/cmu-delphi/epiforecast-R.
