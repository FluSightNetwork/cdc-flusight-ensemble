anonymity: named
data_source1: ILINet
data_source2: 
this_model_is_an_ensemble: FALSE
methods: Uses the Empirical Bayes method as described here: http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004382, but using smaller local transformations to form the prior, and starting trajectories with week 31.  A small amount of smoothing is applied when calculating target distributions.  All parameter settings are heuristically chosen.  All training seasons precede the test season, and observations from the test season use mimicPastEpidataDF to approximate what the ILINet report for the forecast week looked like.  The code for generating these forecasts is available at https://github.com/cmu-delphi/epiforecast-R.
