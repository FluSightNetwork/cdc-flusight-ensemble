\caption{Comparison of the top three statistical models ({\tt Delphi-Stat}, {\tt Delphi-DeltaDensity1}, {\tt ReichLab-KCDE}) and the top three compartmental models, ({\tt LANL-DBM}, {\tt CU-EKF\_SIRS}, {\tt CU-RHF\_SIRS}) based on best average region-season forecast skill. The difference column represents the difference in the average probability assigned to the eventual outcome for the target in each row. Positive values indicate the top statistical models showed more average skill than the compartmental models.}
