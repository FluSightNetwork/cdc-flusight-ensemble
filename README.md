This repository is the central nervous system for the FluSight Network, a consortium of researchers and public health officials working together to create real-time forecasts for influenza in the US.

There is a lot of data and code in this repository. We have over 20 models' forecasts for the past eight flu seasons. To help you navigate it, here are some quick links to relevant information and files.

 - This collaboration is currently centered around participation in the [CDC FluSight challenge](https://predict.phiresearchlab.org/) which has run since the 2013/2014 season.
 - In the fall of 2017, [Nick](http://reichlab.io) wrote a [blog post describing the new FluSight Network effort effort](http://reichlab.io/2017/11/28/flusight-ensemble.html). This is a good place to start to get an overview of this collaborative effort.
 - A [pre-print of the first academic paper resulting from this collaboration is available on biorxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/08/24/397190). This paper compares performance of the models over the 2010/2011 through 2016/2017 flu seasons. The [source code for manuscript itself](https://github.com/FluSightNetwork/cdc-flusight-ensemble/tree/master/writing/comparison) also lives in this repository.
 - We have an interactive visualization of the forecasts available at [flusightnetwork.io](http://flusightnetwork.io).
 - The technical details and structure of this repository is described on [the wiki for this repository](https://github.com/FluSightNetwork/cdc-flusight-ensemble/wiki).
 - We have [specific guidelines for how to join the FluSight Network and participate](https://github.com/FluSightNetwork/cdc-flusight-ensemble/blob/master/guidelines.md) in the current season. 
 - We are working on a [second manuscript with details on our building a collaborative ensemble](https://github.com/FluSightNetwork/cdc-flusight-ensemble/tree/master/writing/ensemble).
 - The [Reich Lab](http://reichlab.io) is building a forecast repository, [Zoltar](http://www.zoltardata.com/), which boasts a standardized API access and visualization framework. The forecasts from this FluSight Network project, in addition to living here on github, also have been stored in [a Zoltar project](http://www.zoltardata.com/project/4).
