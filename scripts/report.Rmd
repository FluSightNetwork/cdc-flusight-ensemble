## Overview
In the 2016/2017 influenza season, the CDC ran the 4thth annual FluSight competition and received XX submissions from XX teams. During the season, analysts at the CDC built an ensemble model that combined all of the submitted models by taking the "average" forecast for each influenza target. This model was one of the top performing models for the entire season.

In March 2017 the FluSight Network was founded to create a collaborative network of influenza forecasters. This group worked throughout 2017 to create a set of guidelines and an experimental design that would enable submission of a publicly available, multi-team, real-time submission of an ensemble model with validated and performance-based weights for each model (i.e. not a simple average of models). 

This document provides an executive summary of that effort, highlighting the results and documenting the chosen model that was designated for real-time submission during the 2017/2018 U.S. influenza season.
