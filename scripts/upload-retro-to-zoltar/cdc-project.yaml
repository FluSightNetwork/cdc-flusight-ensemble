      description: >-
          The onset of the season is defined as the MMWR surveillance week (http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/script/downloads.aspx) 
          when the percentage of visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) reported through ILINet reaches or 
          exceeds the baseline value for three consecutive weeks (updated 2016-2017 
          ILINet baseline values for the US and each HHS region will be available 
          at http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm the week of October 10, 2016). 
          Forecasted 'onset' week values should be for the first week of that three week period.
